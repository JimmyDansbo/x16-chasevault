Too build PRG file, run **build.sh** in bash (Git bash is recommended for Windows).

Build requirements: gcc, cc65

Please note at this time that the game is not yet fully
playable. It is under active development, so the master branch is not stable.

Last working demo commit: https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-chasevault/tree/6245e0d58c70b345e5aefb0f7939671658d818a2
This build will allow you to move the player around, eat pellets, and die if touched by an enemy unless still vulnerable after the player eats a power pellet. The first two levels are fully playable, but no further levels have been developed at this time.
