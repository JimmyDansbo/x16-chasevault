Too build PRG file, run **build.sh** in bash (Git bash is recommended for Windows).

Build requirements: gcc, cc65

Please note at this time that the game is not yet fully
playable. It is under active development, so the master branch is not stable.

Last working demo commit: https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-chasevault/tree/65378ed0beffbb80fd9d89856c7ff8a05f39a800
The levels 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 17 and 18 are fully playable in this build, but no further levels have been developed at this time.
