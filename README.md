Too build PRG file, run **build.sh** in bash (Git bash is recommended for Windows).

Build requirements: gcc, cc65

Please note at this time that the game is not yet fully
playable. It is under active development, so the master branch is not stable.

Last working demo commit: https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-chasevault/tree/dff987812fe4adf5c1b890364f50b2083e52b127
This build will allow you to move the player around, eat pellets, and die if touched by an enemy. Enemies at this time do not move or become vulnerable.
