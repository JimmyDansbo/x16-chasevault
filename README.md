Too build PRG file, run **build.sh** in bash (Git bash is recommended for Windows).

Build requirements: gcc, cc65

Please note at this time that the game is not yet fully
playable. It is under active development, so the master branch is not stable.

Last working demo commit: https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-chasevault/tree/6a13c050f2e9a674f14ff1f10ccf38f70a9ba562

The levels 1-27, 33 and 34 are fully playable in this build, but no further levels have been developed at this time.
