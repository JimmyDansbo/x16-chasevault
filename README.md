Too build PRG file, run **build.sh** in bash (Git bash is recommended for Windows).

Build requirements: gcc, cc65

Please note at this time that the game is not yet fully
playable. It is under active development, so the master branch is not stable.

Last working demo commit: https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-chasevault/tree/73dbb4b066d9d88b1055c92d475b9071c70240e2
The first two levels are fully playable in this build, but no further levels have been developed at this time.
