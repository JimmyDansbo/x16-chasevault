Too build PRG file, run **build.sh** in bash (Git bash is recommended for Windows).

Build requirements: gcc, cc65

Please note at this time that the game is not yet fully
playable. It is under active development, so the master branch is not stable.

Last working demo commit: https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-chasevault/tree/037321eb3dbb3eca3c24e0320d1845c2c648322f
The levels 1, 2 (below level 1) and 9 (to the right of level 1) are fully playable in this build, but no further levels have been developed at this time.
